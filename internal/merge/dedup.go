// DedupFiles removes transactions that a later input file re-exports from an
// earlier one, keeping every row within a single file. Two rows are considered
// the same when their booking date, amount, payee and purpose match — the
// signature of a row that shows up twice because two exports covered an
// overlapping period. Files are processed in order and compared as multisets:
// for each identity a later file keeps its surplus beyond what earlier files
// already contributed, so a longer export whose window genuinely contains the
// same real booking twice still lands once per real occurrence. Identical rows
// inside one file are legitimate bookings (two same-day purchases, split
// payments) and always survive. It returns the kept transactions in input
// order and the number of rows dropped.
